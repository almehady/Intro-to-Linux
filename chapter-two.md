## Linux History

The Linux distributions created in the mid-90s provided the basis for fully free (in the sense of freedom, not zero cost) computing and became a driving force in the open source software movement. In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced their support for the Linux platform and began major development efforts as well.
