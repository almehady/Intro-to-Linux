# What Is a Process?

A process is simply an instance of one or more related tasks (threads) executing on your computer. It is not the same as a program or a command. A single command may actually start several processes simultaneously. Some processes are independent of each other and others are related. A failure of one process may or may not affect the others running on the system.

Processes use many system resources, such as memory, CPU (central processing unit) cycles, and peripheral devices, such as network cards, hard drives, printers and displays. The operating system (especially the kernel) is responsible for allocating a proper share of these resources to each process and ensuring overall optimized system utilization.

## Process Types

A terminal window (one kind of command shell) is a process that runs as long as needed. It allows users to execute programs and access resources in an interactive environment. You can also run programs in the background, which means they become detached from the shell.

Processes can be of different types according to the task being performed. Here are some different process types, along with their descriptions and examples:

## Process Scheduling and States

A critical kernel function called the scheduler constantly shifts processes on and off the CPU, sharing time according to relative priority, how much time is needed and how much has already been granted to a task.

When a process is in a so-called running state, it means it is either currently executing instructions on a CPU, or is waiting to be granted a share of time (a time slice) so it can execute. All processes in this state reside on what is called a run queue and on a computer with multiple CPUs, or cores, there is a run queue on each.

However, sometimes processes go into what is called a sleep state, generally when they are waiting for something to happen before they can resume, perhaps for the user to type something. In this condition, a process is said to be sitting on a wait queue.

There are some other less frequent process states, especially when a process is terminating. Sometimes, a child process completes, but its parent process has not asked about its state. Amusingly, such a process is said to be in a zombie state; it is not really alive, but still shows up in the system's list of processes.

## Process and Thread IDs
At any given time, there are always multiple processes being executed. The operating system keeps track of them by assigning each a unique process ID (PID) number. The PID is used to track process state, CPU usage, memory use, precisely where resources are located in memory, and other characteristics.

New PIDs are usually assigned in ascending order as processes are born. Thus, PID 1 denotes the init process (initialization process), and succeeding processes are gradually assigned higher numbers.

The table explains the PID types and their descriptions:

## Terminating a Process

At some point, one of your applications may stop working properly. How do you eliminate it?

To terminate a process, you can type kill -SIGKILL <pid> or kill -9 <pid>.

Note, however, you can only kill your own processes; those belonging to another user are off limits, unless you are root.

## User and Group IDs


Many users can access a system simultaneously, and each user can run multiple processes. The operating system identifies the user who starts the process by the Real User ID (RUID) assigned to the user.

The user who determines the access rights for the users is identified by the Effective UID (EUID). The EUID may or may not be the same as the RUID.

Users can be categorized into various groups. Each group is identified by the Real Group ID (RGID). The access rights of the group are determined by the Effective Group ID (EGID). Each user can be a member of one or more groups.

Most of the time we ignore these details and just talk about the User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID).

### Load Averages
The load average is the average of the load number for a given period of time. It takes into account processes that are:

            Actively running on a CPU
            Considered runnable, but waiting for a CPU to become available
            Sleeping: i.e. waiting for some kind of resource (typically, I/O) to become available.

Note: Linux differs from other UNIX-like operating systems in that it includes the sleeping processes. Furthermore, it only includes so-called uninterruptible sleepers, those which cannot be awakened easily.

The load average can be viewed by running w, top or uptime. We will explain the numbers on the next page.

### Interpreting Load Averages
The load average is displayed using three numbers (0.45, 0.17, and 0.12) in the below screenshot. Assuming our system is a single-CPU system, the three load average numbers are interpreted as follows:

            0.45: For the last minute the system has been 45% utilized on average.
            0.17: For the last 5 minutes utilization has been 17%.
            0.12: For the last 15 minutes utilization has been 12%.

If we saw a value of 1.00 in the second position, that would imply that the single-CPU system was 100% utilized, on average, over the past 5 minutes; this is good if we want to fully use a system. A value over 1.00 for a single-CPU system implies that the system was over-utilized: there were more processes needing CPU than CPU was available.

### Background and Foreground Processes
Linux supports background and foreground job processing. A job in this context is just a command launched from a terminal window. Foreground jobs run directly from the shell, and when one foreground job is running, other jobs need to wait for shell access (at least in that terminal window if using the GUI) until it is completed. This is fine when jobs complete quickly. But this can have an adverse effect if the current job is going to take a long time (even several hours) to complete.

In such cases, you can run the job in the background and free the shell for other tasks. The background job will be executed at lower priority, which, in turn, will allow smooth execution of the interactive tasks, and you can type other commands in the terminal window while the background job is running. By default, all jobs are executed in the foreground. You can put a job in the background by suffixing & to the command, for example: updatedb &.

You can either use CTRL-Z to suspend a foreground job or CTRL-C to terminate a foreground job and can always use the bg and fg commands to run a process in the background and foreground, respectively.

### Managing Jobs
The jobs utility displays all jobs running in background. The display shows the job ID, state, and command name, as shown here.

jobs -l provides the same information as jobs, and adds the PID of the background jobs.

The background jobs are connected to the terminal window, so, if you log off, the jobs utility will not show the ones started from that window.
