# Linux Hisoty

The Linux distributions created in the mid-90s provided the basis for fully free (in the sense of freedom, not zero cost) computing and became a driving force in the open source software movement. In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced their support for the Linux platform and began major development efforts as well.

Today, Linux powers more than half of the servers on the Internet, the majority of smartphones (via the Android system, which is built on top of Linux), and all of the worldâ€™s most powerful supercomputers.
